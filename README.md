I was inspired by the events site you created in class. 
With everything going on with Covid-19, and with the cancellation of any in-person graduation, my friends and I have been trying our best to organize socially-distanced gatherings. 
But, everyone's comfort level is different, so in particular I think it would be great to not only centralize the events in one simple place open to everyone (not like calendary where people have to be invited), 
but also let people see how many people are attending and who they are before they respond to the event.
